🧠 How Amazon S3 Works (Simple Explanation)

Amazon S3 = Online storage locker where you store files (called objects) in containers (called buckets). You can then upload, download, organize, and manage your data over the internet.

1. Create a Bucket – Your main folder in S3.


2. Upload Files (Objects) – Put your files into the bucket.


3. Access or Share Files – Use URLs or permissions to download/share.


4. Manage Files – Add versions, set expiration, move to Glacier, etc.)
